# create
A batch file to create the basic structure for a web app.

To use it simply download it to your computer and copy it to a freshly created folder on your PC (Windows Only).
#Then if running from the command line:
       type 'create.bat' and press enter
#If running from git Bash:
       type 'start create.bat' press enter
       
#The script creates these folders:

assets
assets/images
assets/css
assets/javascript

and these files

index.html
assest/css/style.css
assest/css/resets.css
assets/javascript/app.js

Just a simple program to make your day a little longer. :)

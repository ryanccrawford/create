# create
A batch file to create the basic structure for a web app.

To use it simply download it to your computer and copy it to a freshly created folder on your PC (Windows Only).
#Then if running from the command line:
       type 'create.bat' and press enter
#If running from git Bash:
       type 'start create.bat' press enter
       
#The script creates these folders:

-assets
-assets/images
-assets/css
-assets/javascript

and these files

-index.html
-assest/css/style.css
-assest/css/resets.css
-assets/javascript/app.js

Just a simple program to make your day a little longer. :)
